Discovery Through the Power of Mathematics, Physics, and the Imagination
Finally, it is important to remember that many of the most far-reaching and
revolutionary discoveries in astronomy were not solely the direct result of observa-
tions with telescopes or numerical simulations with computers. Rather, they also
sprang from the imagination of inspired theorists thinking in deep and original
ways about how to understand the data, and making testable predictions about
new ideas. Examples range from the prediction that the chemical elements heavier
than hydrogen and helium must have been created inside nuclear furnaces in the
cores of stars, to the idea that the infant universe underwent a period of extremely
rapid expansion called inflation, to the prediction of exotic objects like black holes,
neutron stars, and white dwarfs, and the prediction that planets are a typical by-
product of normal star formation.
In the coming decade, major challenges loom that require the development of
fundamental new theories. Observations and computer simulations are necessary
components, but to complete the path from discovery to understanding, theorists
will need to freely exercise their imaginations.
